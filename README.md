### Youtube Search

YouTube Search is an Web App that uses YouTube API v3 to show resulting list of videos corresponding to the searched term/phrase.
#### Features!

  - User can search for any videos
  - Results on each page can be sorted (Ascending) by Name of the video or the Publishing Date of the video
  - User can use Next/Previous buttons at the bottom of each page to navigate between results on different pages.

#### Tech
YouTube Search uses the following technologies:
* [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/) - Standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - Style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript
) - Scripting Language
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

#### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.
###### Prerequisites
A web browser ( preferably Google Chrome).
###### Installations
- Download the zip file of the project either from the [Github](https://github.com/appurva21/youtube-search) or the from the attachment with the mail.
- Unzip the folder and open index.html file in the browser.

#### Running the Test

- User can search for any videos by typing in the search field and then clicking the search button.
- Each Page shows 10 most relevant results which can be sorted by Name or Publishing Date of the video by hovering over the Sort By menu on the right.
- User can navigate between results on different pages by clicking on Next/Previous buttons on the bottom of each page.

#### Assumptions & Limitations
- Each result page will have 10 result, where first page will have top 10 most relevant videos followed by next 10 relevant videos on the next page and so on.
- Sorting feature provides the functionality to sort the list of videos on a single result page, i.e. each sorting feature user can sort result on that particular page only.
- Seaching by any term/phrase will always give the list relevant videos only. Resulting list will not have any item corresponding to a Channel or a Playlist on youtube.
